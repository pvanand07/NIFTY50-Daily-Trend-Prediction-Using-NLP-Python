# NIFTY50-Prediction-Twitter-NLP-Python
This project predicts stock market performance using sentiment analysis of tweets collected using snscrape library. The sentiment is visualized using histograms and bar plots. It can be useful for investors and traders as an additional indicator for stock market predictions.

## Note
Please keep in mind that the sentiment analysis is not always accurate, it may be influenced by the use of slang, emojis, sarcasm and the fact that the tweets are short, so it is better to combine the sentiment analysis with other techniques to get a better understanding of the sentiments.
